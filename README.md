This was originally written in 2013.

It is a good introduction on how to write selenium tests for ExtJS based web applications.

It uses ExtJS 4.2.

While ExtJS at this point in time is at version 6.5.3, the overall demo is still relevant.

Nowadays, if one can afford it, they will write their end-to-end testing using Sencha Test, which can also be integrated into Selenium.

If one doesn't have the money for Sencha Test since it is a commercial product, there are many other options.

Do some searches.

In the meantime, this can provide you with a starting point.

More than likely as your testing needs become more sophisticated, you might have to extend WebDriver in order to support asynchronous features of ExtJS or any other async JavaScript based framework for that matter.

This is written and provided as is.

Note: the reference in the PDF to TestSetup.zip is actually located in the TestSetupArchive folder.  I had to split the original zip file because it was larger than 100 mg which is a hard limit for a single file in GitHub.

I created the split ZIP using a commercial version of ZIP and tested "unzipping" it using Windows 10's built-in Windows Explorer command.
